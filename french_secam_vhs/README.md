DISCLAIMER: highly experimental  

this graph can be used to see the VHS RF signal and color of 
a french secam RF capture. the graph decodes the color at the
 1.1mhz carrier. 

I created this graph out of my own curiousity. I am posting it 
to share info with other users. I am not actively working on it.

You could technically use this, and my align syncs graph, to make
a end result video. The align syncs graph would need to be modified
to work with color information files too.
