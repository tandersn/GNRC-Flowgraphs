# GNRC Tutorial

This is a very "trial by fire" "crash course" intro to GNU Radio Companion. This tutorial will be centric to the ld/cvbs/vhs -decode projects. It is not meant to be all inclusiver or authoratative in any way. Everything I've learned has been through expirementation, trial and error, and reading reference materials.
